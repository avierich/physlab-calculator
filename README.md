# physlab-calculator

This script is meant to accept a .csv containing an equation, and experimentally obtained values for each variable in the equation.

The script will then output a sample calculation of the first row of values and output that in LaTeX for you to put in your report.

Most significantly however this will also find the error formula from the given formula and then output it explicitly with the equation and a sample calculation in LaTeX.
